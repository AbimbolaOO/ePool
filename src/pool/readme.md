# Pool Creation

## Expected behaviour of ePool

Step and the reaction to the step

- User types
  - Pool creator (UserCRT)
  - Pool connector (UserConn)

- A UserCRT creates a media pool
  - The UserCRT get a qrCode link that anyone who scans the link is automatically added to that media pool;
    - UserCRT is also required to provide a username if they do not have a account with validated username
  - When UserConn join this pool
    - UserConn is given the opportunity to only add image/videos into the pool
    - UserConn is also required to provide there username when they are added to the pool
      - UserConn is only required to provide a username every time they connect to the pool for the first except the have a register account with a validated uniques username
    - When UserConn join the pool he get a unique identify that identify them through out the lifecycle of the the pool
